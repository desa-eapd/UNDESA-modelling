###  Strengthening National Capacities

The Core Overlapping Generations Macroeconomy Model (OG-CORE) is an advanced quantitative tool developed to assist governments in analyzing and strategizing economic policies through rigorous "what-if" scenario analysis. OG-CORE is a powerful, flexible, and open-source tool to assess the impact of economic policies, including on population groups and generations across time. The model is particularly useful to study taxation and spending policies, social protection and pension systems, transfers, savings behavior, technological progress, and the effect of demographic changes. This model is used effectively for policy analysis in the United States, Malaysia, India, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Latvia, and within the European Union.

### All Country Projects:

- Are context-specific, implemented in close communication with national partners to address specific national needs and interests.
- Last between 6 to 12 months, depending on the degree of collaboration, data availability, existing technical capacities, and institutional dynamics.
- Require strong collaboration with the participants and the establishment of an active technical modelling team where diverse institutions pool expertise.
